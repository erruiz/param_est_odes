# AM 225: Final Project

This repository contains all files used for the final project. It should be
mentioned that the topic of my project had to change slightly due to some
complications in the execution. The `beta/` directory contains code that I was
originally going to use but had to scrap due to various bugs. The C++ code
is based on Julia code that I wrote in the past. The Julia code can also be
found in the `beta/` directory--- though it is not as efficient as the C++ code!
